This was one of the easier practice assignments. I didn't really have any trouble with implementing anything. I wanted to implement som eexceptions within some functions of ArrayQueue and ArrayStack, though that wasn't possible due to not being able to edit the PracticeAssignment06 Class. Besides that, everything was good.
